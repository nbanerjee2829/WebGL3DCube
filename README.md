# WebGL3DCube
This demo has been modified to make it an educational application for understanding how WebGL renders a 3d cube. An initial animation state is created for the to make it visually appealing when opened for the first time. Rotate X, Y and Z buttons have been given rotation toggling functionalities when clicked. Previously if rotation was disabled then the Rotate buttons did not work, until you toggle rotation. Options to add triangle and remove triangle has been added to make it easier for someone to understand how WebGL uses triangles to create squares. Toggle Depth Test button is implemented, which shows how depth in 3d objects works, a Cycle Speed button to cycle through 3 speed settings (low, med, high) is provided for rotation speed control. A button to cycle values for position and color vertexAttribPointer size is also implemented to show the how the vertex attributes modifications work.
